Hei from Finland! I'm Myles Byrne (neuroplastic). I started using the semantic web when i helped convert the card catalog of the oldest library in the US (Redwood Athenaeum) to digital in the mid-90's. I started working towards decentralised digital democracy  in the 00's when, while working for an e-democracy startup headed by Clinton's press sec. Mike McCurry called Grassroots, i discovered that it was actually an advanced astroturfing system. It was mostly used by corporations like PG&E to manipulate its customers into influencing legislation. Over the 10's i worked on leading projects in Finnish digital health data ecosystem. I tried to get Finland to use Tim Berners-Lee's Solid to provide healthdata pods for national and intl. patients, and academic pods for researchers. I worked for Inrupt in '22, and realised what the Gov4Git whitepaper stated in Jan. '23: Solid is too caught up in the gordian hairball of enterprise SAAS to reach its intended publics. I'm here to integrate health, wellness, and education, using RDF, with exactly the type of system gov4git and soc4git is prototyping. It's been a great journey from Markus Sabadello's Project Danube, to Michiel De Jong's unhosted, to Ruben Verborgh's personal RDF websites, to my own pod project P2PScience, to Solid. But now is the moment for the p2p web to take its place as the realisation of the dream of universal real democracy.
